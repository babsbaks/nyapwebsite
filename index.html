    <h1>NYAP</h1>
    <h2>Not Your Average Pretenders</h2>
    <p>NYAP is a non-profit organziation for young creatives in the Nigerian community. We also welcome young creatives from all backgrounds.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>In Nigeria, most people have very strict parents who do not see the value in going down the path of becoming a creative, instead they want their kids to study traditional subjects like law, engineering and medicine. This sometimes forces people down a career path they do not want to go down for the rest of their life.  The Nigerian community also expects you to behave a certain type of way, which further suppresses who you really are. ‘Not Your Average Pretenders’ is meant to encourage people to step forward and do what they want no matter what others say. This may be in the form of doing what the people around expect of you, while doing what you want on the side (hence the name) or just dropping what is expected of you and then following your dream. NYAP is not only meant to represent Nigerians but anyone who is feeling society pressures to be normal .</p>
